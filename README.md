# Message Decryption and TSP with Simulated Annealing
This report improves upon a Metropolis Hastings algorithm by implementing simulated annealing to decrypt an encrypted message. The application is also generalized to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) known in optimization. 

Final report included as `MCMC_and_Simulated_Annealing.pdf`.

`code25` includes the data used (the corpus), encrypted message, and python scripts used to run the experiment.

To run the baseline Metropolis Hastings algorithm: `python3 run_deciphering.py -i data/warpeace_input.txt -d secret_message.txt`

To run the simulated annealing algorithm as was done in the report: `python3 run_deciphering_sa.py -i data/warpeace_input.txt -d secret_message.txt -e 50000 -b 0.3 -a 0.995 -k 5000`
